# AI Search Visibility Tracker — Phase 1 MVP

Track how a brand appears inside **real** AI interfaces — ChatGPT, Gemini, and
Google AI Overviews — using Playwright to capture what users actually see.

> This is a lightweight local MVP. No Redis, Celery, Postgres, or microservices.
> Just SQLite + local JSON + an async pipeline.

## Architecture

```
   Playwright Capture     →  Raw JSON Storage  →  NER Processing  →  Ranking  →  Analytics API  →  React Dashboard
   (chatgpt, gemini,         /storage/raw/        spaCy + rapidfuzz   SQLite       FastAPI            Vite + Tailwind
    google_ai)               /storage/processed/                                                      Recharts
```

Each layer is decoupled:

- `backend/providers/*` — Playwright adapters (one per provider).
- `backend/capture/` — orchestrator: runs providers, writes raw JSON, kicks off processing.
- `backend/storage/` — append-only JSON store (raw is **immutable**).
- `backend/processing/` — spaCy NER + rapidfuzz normalization.
- `backend/ranking/` — visibility / position / citation scoring.
- `backend/analytics/` — read-only views for the dashboard.
- `backend/api/` — FastAPI routes.

## Setup

### 1. Backend

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install the browser. patchright ships a Chrome build patched for CDP-stealth
# (required to pass Cloudflare on ChatGPT and Google). If you also have Google
# Chrome installed on your system, it'll be used preferentially via channel="chrome".
patchright install chrome
python -m playwright install chromium   # fallback only

python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

cp .env.example .env

# create SQLite tables
python -m scripts.init_db
```

### 2. Provider auth status

All three providers run **anonymously** — no login required.

| Provider    | Login? | Notes                                                                                 |
| ----------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `chatgpt`   | No     | Anonymous `chatgpt.com` flow. Cloudflare Turnstile is handled by the stealth layer.   |
| `gemini`    | No     | `gemini.google.com` allows signed-out queries; consent dialog is auto-dismissed.      |
| `google_ai` | No     | Anonymous Google Search; consent dialog auto-dismissed.                               |

Optional: if you *want* to use a signed-in session (higher ChatGPT rate limits,
or Gemini features only available to logged-in users), run:

```bash
python -m scripts.login_provider chatgpt
python -m scripts.login_provider gemini
```

Cookies persist to `./.browser_profiles/<provider>/` and are reused automatically.

#### Cloudflare / consent on capture

ChatGPT and Google Search sit behind Cloudflare Turnstile, which detects
Playwright at the **CDP (Chrome DevTools Protocol)** level — no JS-level
stealth script can hide this. We address it with:

- **patchright** — a drop-in replacement for `playwright` that patches CDP
  fingerprints. This is the actual fix; the JS stealth and launch args alone
  are not enough. Falls back to vanilla playwright if patchright isn't installed
  (you'll likely get challenged in that case).
- **Real Chrome** (`channel="chrome"`) when installed, otherwise patchright's
  bundled Chrome build, otherwise bundled Chromium.
- **Persistent profile** so clearance cookies survive between runs.
- **`wait_for_cloudflare`** that pauses while the challenge is visible.
- **JS-level stealth** as a belt-and-suspenders defense in depth.

**`HEADLESS=false` clears challenges far more reliably than headless mode.**
Install Google Chrome (not just Chromium) for best results.

### 3. (Optional) Seed example data so you can poke the dashboard without running a capture

```bash
python -m scripts.seed_example
```

### 4. Start backend

```bash
uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
# → http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

### 5. Start frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
# → http://localhost:5173
```

## Usage

1. Open the dashboard at `http://localhost:5173`.
2. Create a project: name, domain, up to 5 prompts, optional competitors.
3. Click **Run capture**. The backend launches Playwright in the background,
   visits each provider, submits each prompt, waits for streaming completion,
   captures the rendered DOM + a full-page screenshot, and writes a raw JSON
   artifact under `storage/raw/`.
4. The processing layer runs immediately after each capture: spaCy NER →
   rapidfuzz normalization → mentions + citations persisted to SQLite.
5. The Overview / Runs / Competitors / Providers pages query the analytics API
   and render charts (Recharts) + tables.

## What gets stored per run

```json
{
  "provider": "chatgpt",
  "prompt": "best project management software",
  "timestamp": "2026-05-25T18:00:00Z",
  "response_text": "...",
  "citations": [{ "title": "Notion", "url": "https://notion.so", "domain": "notion.so" }],
  "links": [...],
  "metadata": { "response_time": 12.3, "has_citations": true },
  "screenshot_path": "storage/screenshots/<run_id>.png",
  "html_path": "storage/html/<run_id>.html",
  "has_ai_overview": true
}
```

Raw data is immutable. Re-running the processing layer (`POST /api/projects/{id}/reprocess`
or the **Reprocess** button) re-derives mentions, citations, and rankings without
re-scraping.

## Dashboard pages

- **Overview** — visibility score, mention/citation totals, top-brands bar chart,
  per-provider pie, a live **Capture Pipeline** panel, and a **Visibility Trend**
  line chart (Competitor AI Visibility vs. your AI Agent Mentions over time).
- **Prompt Runs** — every (provider × prompt) run with status + detail modal.
- **Competitors** — co-mention analysis vs. the target brand.
- **Providers** — brand × provider mention matrix.
- **History** — chronological log of competitors added (manual vs. auto-detected)
  and queries added.

### Live capture pipeline

Clicking **Run capture** pre-creates one `pending` run per (provider × prompt)
and runs them in the background. The Overview page's **Capture Pipeline** panel
polls every 2s and shows each step move through `Queued → Running →
Succeeded/Failed`, grouped by provider — a Profound-style orchestrator view that
stops polling once all steps settle.

## Visibility score

```
visibility_score =
   (prompts_where_brand_appears / total_prompts) * 100
   + first_mention_bonus            (up to 10)
   + min(citations, 5) * 2          (up to 10)
   + multi_provider_bonus           ((providers_seen - 1) * 5)
   → capped at 100
```

## Notes on selectors

ChatGPT and Gemini ship UI changes regularly. Each provider keeps multiple
fallback selectors. When a capture fails, the run row in the dashboard shows the
error, and the screenshot + HTML are saved so you can replay processing later
without re-scraping. To re-run all processing after updating selectors or NER:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/projects/<id>/reprocess
```

## Tech stack

- **Backend**: Python, FastAPI, Playwright (async), SQLAlchemy 2, SQLite, spaCy, rapidfuzz.
- **Frontend**: React 18, Vite, TailwindCSS, Recharts, shadcn-styled components.
